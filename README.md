This game is created with Pygame.
I don't have used collision detection or PyMunc.
The player use a Direction Class which shows in which direction to go.

The Mouse are able to diverge or merge together to heal.
But I have not integrated anything where they need endurance or health.
The snake use the mouse as controller.
And Team 1 of the Mice use WASD and Q and E for diverge and merge.
The second team use Up, Down, Left and Right and ',' and '-' for diverge and merge.
This concept of an hive-intelligence really works fine and I think I will reuse it.
The Direction Class and a Class for Colors work fine too.

Neutral Mouse automatically join a team if in closer distance to one of your team members.

This was only an Learn Project and everyone is welcome to reuse concepts or code.
If you have feedback, I would be happy to learn :)
